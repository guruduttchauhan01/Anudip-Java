<h1><b>Question Solved</b></h1>
<b>Question 1:</b> Write a program to check whether a number is a Strong number or not. 
              Strong number is a special number whose sum of factorial of digits is equal to the original number. 
              For example: 145 is a strong number. Since, 1! + 4! + 5! = 145 
              [Hint: conditional operator,method,use parameterized method to take input] Sample Input 1: 145



<b>Question 2:</b> Write a program to check leap year using if else. How to check whether a given year is a leap year or not. 
              [Hint:Take an input of any number. Store it in some variable say year. If a year is exactly divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year. Or if a year   is exactly divisible by 400 then it is a leap year.] 
              Sample Input 1: 2004

<b>Question 3:</b> Create a program to calculate the annual salary of an employee by using inheritance. Create a class named "User" with the following properties and methods:                           Properties: id(int): representing the id of the User name(String):representing the name of the User Constructor: Declare parameterized constructor to initialize id and                   name. Create a subclass named "Employee" that inherits from the "User" class. Add the following additional properties and methods: Properties: salary(double):representing                the monthly salary of the employee Method: double calculateAnnualSalary():to calculate the annual salary earned by the employee. In the main method, create an object of                 "Employee" class. Calculate the annual salary of the employee and display it.
              [Hint:Use constructor or setter methods to set the value] Sample Input: Id:1 name: john salary: 20000
